# Handling Errors

goa makes it possible to describe the errors that a service method may return.
This allows goa to generate documentation and code that support the encoding of
the errors. Errors have a name, a type which may be a primitive type or a user
defined type and a description that is used to generate comments and
documentation.

This document describes how to define errors in goa designs and how to leverage
the generated code to return errors from service methods.

## Design

The goa DSL makes it possible to define error results on methods and on entire
services using the [Error](https://godoc.org/goa.design/goa/dsl#Error)
expression:

```go
var _ = Service("divider", func() {

        // The "div_by_zero" error is defined at the service level and
        // thus may be returned by both "divide" and "integer_divide".
        Error("div_by_zero", func() {
                Description("div_by_zero is the error result returned by the service methods when the right operand is 0.")
        })

        Method("integer_divide", func() {

                // The "has_remainder" error is defined at the method
                // level and is thus specific to "integer_divide".
                Error("has_remainder", func() {
                        Description("has_remainder is the error result returned when an integer division has a remainder.")
                })
                // ...
        })

        Method("divide", func() {
                // ...
        })
})
```

In this example both the `div_by_zero` and `has_remainder` errors use the
default error type `ErrorResult`. This type defines the following fields:

* `Name` is the name of the error. The generated code takes care of initializing
  the field with the name defined in the design during response encoding.
* `ID` is a unique identifier for the specific instance of the error. The idea
  is that this ID may be instrumented making it possible to correlate a user
  error report with service logs, traces etc.
* `Message` is the error message.
* `Temporary` indicates whether the error is temporary.
* `Timeout` indicates whether the error is due to a timeout.
* `Fault` indicates whether the error is due to a server-side fault.

The DSL makes is possible to specify whether an error denotes a temporary
condition and/or a timeout or a server-side fault, here are some examples:

```go
        Error("network_failure", func() {
                Temporary()
        })

        Error("timeout"), func() {
                Timeout()
        })

        Error("remote_timeout", func() {
                Temporary()
                Timeout()
        })

        Error("internal_error", func() {
                Fault()
        })
```

The generated code takes care of initializing the `ErrorResult` `Temporary`,
`Timeout` and `Fault` fields appropriately when encoding the error response.

### Designing HTTP Responses

The HTTP DSL `Response` expression makes it possible to define the HTTP status
code associated with a given error. Going back to our `divider` service example,
the HTTP transport could be designed as follows:

```go
var _ = Service("divider", func() {
        Error("div_by_zero")
        HTTP(func() {
                // Use HTTP status code 400 Bad Request for "div_by_zero"
                // errors.
                Response("div_by_zero", StatusBadRequest)
        })

        Method("integer_divide", func() {
                Error("has_remainder")
                HTTP(func() {
                        Response("has_remainder", StatusExpectationFailed)
                        // ...
                })
        })
        // ...
})
```

## Returning Errors

Given the divider service design above goa generates two helper functions that
build the corresponding errors: `MakeDivByZero` and `MakeHasRemainder`. These
functions accept a Go error as argument making it convenient to map a business
logic error to a specific error result.

Here is an example of what an implementation of `integer_divide` could look
like:

```go
func (s *dividerSvc) IntegerDivide(ctx context.Context, p *dividersvc.IntOperands) (int, error) {
        if p.B == 0 {
                // Use generated function to create error result
                return 0, dividersvc.MakeDivByZero(fmt.Errorf("right operand cannot be 0"))
        }
        if p.A%p.B != 0 {
                return 0, dividersvc.MakeHasRemainder(fmt.Errorf("remainder is %d", p.A%p.B))

        return p.A / p.B, nil
}
```

And that's it! given this goa knows to initialize a `ErrorResult` using the
provided error to initiliaze the message field and initializes all the other
fields from the information provided in the design. The generated transport code
also writes the proper HTTP status code as defined in the HTTP DSL. Using the
generated command line tool to verify:

```bash
./dividercli -v divider integer-divide -a 1 -b 2
> GET http://localhost:8080/idiv/1/2
< 417 Expectation Failed
< Content-Length: 68
< Content-Type: application/json
< Date: Thu, 22 Mar 2018 01:34:33 GMT
{"name":"has_remainder","id":"dlqvenWL","message":"remainder is 1"}
```

## Using Custom Error Types

The `Error` expression allows specifying a type for the error result thereby
overridding the default consisting of `ErrorResult`. Any type can be used for
defining the shape of the error result. Here is an example using string as error
result type:

```go
Error("not_found", String, "not_found is the result returned when there is no bottle with the given ID.")
```

Note how the description can be defined inline when the type is defined
explicitly. The type may be `ErrorResult` which makes it possible to define a
description inline in this case as well.

There are a couple of caveats to be aware of when using custom error result
types:

 1. The `Temporary`, `Timeout` and `Fault` expressions have no effect on code
    generation in this case as they otherwise set the corresponding field values
    on the `ErrorResult` struct.

 2. If the custom type is a user defined type and if it is used to define
    multiple errors on the same method then goa must be told which attribute
    contains the error name. The value of this attribute is compared with the
    names of the errors as defined in the design by the encoding and decoding
    code to infer the proper encoding details (e.g. HTTP status code). The
    attribute is identified using the special `struct:error:name` meta,
    must be a string and must be required:

```go
var InsertConflict = ResultType("application/vnd.service.insertconflict", func() {
        Description("InsertConflict is the type of the error values returned when insertion fails because of a conflict")
        Attributes(func() {
                Attribute("conflict_value", String)
                Attribute("name", String, "name of error used by goa to encode response", func() {
                        Meta("struct:error:name")
                Attribute("name", String, "name of error used by goa to encode response", func() {
                        Metadata("struct:error:name")
                })
                Required("conflict_value", "name")
        })
        View("default", func() {
                Attribute("conflict_value")
                // Note: error_name is omitted from the default view.
                // in this example error_name is an attribute used to identify
                // the field containing the name of the error and is not
                // encoded in the response sent to the client.
        })
})
```

 3. User types used to define custom error types cannot have an attribute
    named `error_name` as the generated code defines a `ErrorName`
    function on the error struct.

## Error HTTP Response Encoding

> Note: this section gives insight into how goa generates the encoding code for
> errors, you don't need to read it to simply use errors in goa.

The goa code generators leverage the HTTP status code provided in the `HTTP`
expression if any to encode errors into HTTP responses. The code first switches
on the type of the error value and matches that with the type of the errors
defined in the design. If the type is a user provided type and has and attribute
with the "struct:error:name" meta defined then it compares the value of the
corresponding field with the name of the errors in the design.
