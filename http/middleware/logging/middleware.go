/*
Package logging implements a middleware that logs incoming HTTP requests and
outgoing responses. The middleware creates a short unique request ID for each
incoming request and logs it with the request and corresponding response
details.

The middleware logs the incoming requests HTTP method and path as well as the
originator of the request. The originator is computed by looking at the
X-Forwarded-For HTTP header or - absent of that - the originating IP. The
middleware also logs the response HTTP status code, body length (in bytes) and
timing information.

The package also defines the Logger interface it uses internally so that
different logger backends may be used. The default logger used by the middleware
is the Go stdlib logger.
