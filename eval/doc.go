/*
Package eval implements a DSL engine for executing arbitrary Go DSLs.

DSLs executed via eval consist of package functions that build up expressions
upon execution.

A DSL that allows describing a service and its endpoints could look like this:

    var _ = Service("service name")              // Defines the service "service name"

    var _ = Endpoint("endpoint name", func() {   // Defines the endpoint "endpoint name"
        Description("some endpoint description") // Sets the endpoint description
    })

DSL keywords are simply package functions that can be nested using anonymous
functions as last argument. Upon execution the DSL functions create expression
structs. The expression structs created by the top level functions on process
start (both Service and Endpoint in this example) should be stored in special
expressions called root expressions. The DSL implements both the expression and
root expression structs, the only requirement is that they implement the eval
package Expression and Root interfaces respectively.

Keeping with the example above, Endpoint creates instances of the following
EndpointExpression struct:

    type EndpointExpression struct {
        Name string
        DSLFunc func()
    }

where Name gets initialized with the first argument and DSLFunc with the second.
ServiceExpression is the root expression that contains the instances of
EndpointExpression created by the Endpoint function:

    type ServiceExpression struct {
        Name string
        Endpoints []eval.Expression
    }

The Endpoint DSL function simply initializes a EndpointExpression and stores it
in the Endpoints field of the root ServiceExpression:

    func Endpoint(name string, fn func()) {
        ep := &EndpointExpression{Name: name, DSLFunc: fn}
        Design.Endpoints = append(Design.Endpoints, ep)
    }

where Design is a package variable holding the ServiceExpression root
expression:

    // Design is the DSL root expression.
    var Design *ServiceExpression = &ServiceExpression{}

The Service function simply sets the Name field of Service:

    func Service(name string) {
        Design.Name = name
    }

Once the process is loaded the Design package variable contains an instance of
ServiceExpression which in turn contains all the instances of EndpointExpression
that were created via the Endpoint function. Note that at this point the
Description function used in the Endpoint DSL hasn't run yet as it is called by
the anonymous function stored in the DSLFunc field of each EndpointExpression
instance. This is where the RunDSL function of package eval comes in.

RunDSL iterates over the initial set of root expressions and calls the
WalkSets method exposed by the Root interface. This method lets the DSL
engine iterate over the sub-expressions that were initialized when the process
loaded.

In this example the ServiceExpression implementation of WalkSets simply
passes the Endpoints field to the iterator:

    func (se *ServiceExpression) WalkSets(it eval.SetWalker) {
        it(se.Endpoints)
    }

Each expression in an expression set may optionally implement the Source,
Validator and Finalizer interfaces:

- Expressions that are initialized via a child DSL implement Source which
  provides RunDSL with the corresponding anonymous function.

- Expressions that need to be validated implement the Validator interface.

- Expressions that require an additional pass after validation implement the
  Finalizer interface.

In our example EndpointExpression implements Source and return its DSLFunc
member in the implementation of the Source interface DSL function:

    func (ep *EndpointExpression) Source() func() {
        return ep.DSLFunc
    }

EndpointExpression could also implement the Validator Validate method to check
that the name of the endpoint is not empty for example.

The execution of the DSL thus happens in three phases: in the first phase RunDSL
executes all the DSLs of all the source expressions in each expression set. In
this initial phase the DSLs being executed may append to the expression set
and/or may register new expression roots. In the second phase RunDSL validates
all the validator expressions and in the last phase it calls Finalize on all the
finalizer expressions.

The eval package exposes functions that the implementation of the DSL can take
advantage of to report errors, such as ReportError, InvalidArg and
IncompatibleDSL. The engine records the errors being reported but keeps running
the current phase so that multiple errors may be reported at once.  This means
that the DSL implementation must maintain a consistent state for the duration of
one iteration even though some input may be incorrect (for example it may elect
to create default value expressions instead of leaving them nil to avoid panics
later on).

The package exposes other helper functions such as Execute which allows running
a DSL function manually or IsTop which reports whether the expression being
currently built is a top level expression (such as Service and Endpoint in our
example).
