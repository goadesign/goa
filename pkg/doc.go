/*
Package goa implements a Go framework for writing microservices that promotes
best practice by providing a single source of truth from which server code,
client code, and documentation is derived. The code generated by goa follows
the clean architecture pattern where composable modules are generated for the
transport, endpoint, and business logic layers. The goa package contains
middleware, plugins, and other complementary functionality that can be
leveraged in tandem with the generated code to implement complete
microservices in an efficient manner. By using Goa for developing
microservices, implementers donâ€™t have to worry with the documentation
getting out of sync from the implementation as goa takes care of generating
OpenAPI specifications for HTTP based services and gRPC protocol buffer files
for gRPC based services (or both if the service supports both transports).
Reviewers can also be assured that the implementation follows the
documentation as the code is generated from the same source.
